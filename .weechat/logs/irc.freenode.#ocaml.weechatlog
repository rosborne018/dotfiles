2018-01-24 15:07:42	Misha_B	is it possible to have a function that converts a int to a float if it's a int, but does nothing if it's a float
2018-01-24 15:07:57	Misha_B	something like
2018-01-24 15:08:00	Misha_B	let to_float i : 'a =
2018-01-24 15:08:00	Misha_B	match i with
2018-01-24 15:08:00	Misha_B	| int -> float_of_int i
2018-01-24 15:08:00	Misha_B	| float -> float i;;
2018-01-24 15:08:21	ShalokShalom	xfbs: I just heard by Yaron that OCaml had the operator |! for the functionality of |> and simply changed it to line up with F#

2018-01-24 15:09:21	ShalokShalom	great talk, by the way
2018-01-24 15:11:32	Drup	Misha_B: not like that, no
2018-01-24 15:11:42	Drup	what's your use case for such a function ?
2018-01-24 15:12:30	xfbs	Ahh interesting :)
2018-01-24 15:12:58	Misha_B	have a function that get's the area of a circle from it's radius
2018-01-24 15:13:11	Misha_B	but can be input with int and float
2018-01-24 15:14:19	Drup	Right
2018-01-24 15:14:35	Drup	so the only way in ocaml to have inputs that are "either int of float" is to create a new sum types
2018-01-24 15:15:24	Misha_B	ok thanks
